# Capstone-Project: Social Media Analytics

In this project, we analyzed a dataset comprising social media messages (tweets and Facebook posts) from United States politicians in 2013, spanning two days. We parsed the labels and text of the messages to add additional data on hashtag use, message sentiment, and poster identification, which can be used to compare politicians across several vectors.

In the first section, we organized the data by adding several additional columns to the dataframe to include information on name, location, position, sentiment, and hashtags, which we parsed from some of the text contained in the original CSV. This reformatting made the analysis easier in the following stage.

In the second section, we dived deeper into actually analyzing the social media messages in the CSV. We have filtered data by information about the poster and did different analyses on hashtags and sentiments to compare the positive and negative feelings on various topics between different politicians. We also explored which hashtags are most popular and what their average sentiments are.

### Note:
To keep the starter file from becoming too crowded, all the tests have been moved to the file social_tests.py. The functions in this file are called at the bottom of social.py.
